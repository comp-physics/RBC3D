RBC3D is a flow solver for soft capsules and cells. 
It implements the methods discussed in [Zhao et al., JCP (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2010.01.024) and more.
In particular, it solves the boundary integral form of the Stokes equations via an algorithm tailored for cell-scale simulations:

* Spectrally-accurate spherical harmonics represent the deforming surfaces
* Modified Greenâ€™s function approximation used for near-range interactions
* Electrostatic-like repulsion prevents cells from intersecting
* Weak-formulation of no-slip boundary conditions (e.g., vessel walls)
* These features ensure that simulations are robust. Parallel communication (MPI) enables large simulations, such as model vascular networks.
